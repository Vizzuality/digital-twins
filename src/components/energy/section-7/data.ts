However, wind turbines are placed at a much higher height (around 100 m), and many times wind farms are placed in mountainous areas, which have a very particular orography not well captured by global climate models. This makes the estimation of potential wind energy production more challenging.",

Without hesitating he accesses the digital twin model outputs and realises that wind speed at 100 m height is available globally at high resolution. This information is extremely valuable for more accurately estimating the capacity factor, an indicator widely used by the energy sector and that corresponds to the amount of energy that a turbine produces compared to its maximum theoretical output.",

He can now estimate the changes in energy output in different wind farms and in different European countries. He provides this information to policymakers, who will be able to better plan for impacts on the energy demand and energy prices in the future (e.g., under more frequent heatwave episodes) as well as to better estimate particular regions that will become productive for renewable energy in the next decades.",

Those with air conditioning at home can probably cope better with the scorching heat, but there is also a higher risk of blackouts if energy supply cannot meet the peak in the demand. To account for the climate hazards, their accompanying risks, and the possibilities of citizens in different vulnerability situations, an urban planning regulation is in place in Lisbon. Urban green infrastructure is vital to the city’s ability to cope with climate change.",

For example, ventilation corridors in the city valleys can become blocked if new settlements are built, ramping up the city temperature.",

She finds out that the high-resolution model outputs from the digital twin can help her determine energy acclimatisation needs in the city, as well as to calculate other handy indicators during a heatwave, such as the number of tropical nights and the excess heat factor, which can help estimate health risks and hospital submission rates. The digital twin may help urban planners to interact with the simulations for a better understanding of the best adaptation practices against extreme temperatures in urban environments.",
